Use the following command to run the automation:
	python automate.py <ProgramToTranslate.java>

Once the program is finished, a new python file of the same name but with a .py extension will be created 
and it will be ready to be run. The new Python file can be ran with the following command:
	python <ProgramToTranslate.py>

To compare and test the similarity of the original Java program, use the following commands:
	javac <ProgramToTranslate.java>
	java <ProgramToTranslate>
